Introdued to OOPS for first time.
DAY 1: 

Try to understnd oops concept and at the end came to know that class is template for object and object is instance of class.
OOPS are use to keep your code DRY(Do not Repet Yourself).
I learned to create properties and methods.

DAY 2:

Followed all steps which are given in instructions which are really helpful for completing assignment.
